# react-forms-1

### Exercise 1: Basic Form with a Stateful Component
#### Looks good
- Create a new react app called `feelings-app`
- Create a `AppContainer` component to maintain shared stat
- Create a new component called `PersonStats`. In `PersonStats`, create a form that will allow the user to input their name, age, and how they feel right now. 
- Once submitted, display the message: `Hello [NAME]. Your age is [AGE] and you're feeling [FEELING]` below the form. HINT: Use an `inner` property to update a `<div>` 

### Challenge
#### Not attempted - you definitely could have knocked out this challenge and we expected you to do them for the review day which Kevin said when he gave out the assignment
- Create a new react app called `blogger-app`
- Create a `AppContainer` component to maintain shared state (an array of blog posts)
- Create a `HeaderComponent` that displays a `H1` header that says `My Blog`
- Create a `FooterComponent` that displays `This site created by [YOURNAME]`
- Create a `PostList` component that will be used to display a blog entry
- Create a `BlogPost` component that contains a form and allows you to enter a `blogTitle` and a `blogPost`
  - This should be a *controlled component* meaning all values come from and are saved to the component state
  - When the form is submitted, update the shared state which then should update your blog posts in state and then iterate the array creating a new `BlogPost` component for each blog post in the shared state array
